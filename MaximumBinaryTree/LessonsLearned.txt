Idea:
Find max, then recursively build children maximum trees with subarrays. Base case once list is empty

Lessons Learned:
Base case could have been at length 1, since both children are clearly null just return the single element
Could have broken up into more functions to be more readable
In max loop, only needed to find maxIdx. Could have used this to get max value later.
