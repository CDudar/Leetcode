Idea
Recursively traverse nodes, stop and insert once you hit a null child.

Lessons Learned
null check needs to do a direct return, otherwise will hit the else case endlessly.
Need to do root.left / root.right assignment, otherwise insertion at leaf won't work since the parent won't receive the childs root.
